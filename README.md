# STE Gemini Model
Working on a comprehensive guide to STE and all it can do.
STE_Gemini_Model.md is the version I got from Gemini.
STE_Gemini_Conceptual_History.md how we got there.
STE_Grok_Unified.md is a version still working on with Grok

# The Physics of Aptikus
The Aptikus universe operates on a foundational physics engine known as the SpaceTime Energy (STE) Model.
What started as a physical model for the purpose of building a game turned into a deep-dive into the world of both particle and astrophysics and building an analog.

# The Apticus Chaos Engine (CE)
Governed by the rules of STE, the chaos engine is intended to model the flows into ever increasing complexity while maintaining the chaining interlock that lets chaos reign over large complex system.
