# SpaceTime Energy (STE) Theory: The Unified Ether

## 1. The Bug: Physics Forgot the Ether
The vacuum hums—Voyager’s circuits drag, QFT’s zero-point betrays a living substrate. Standard models silo gravity as geometry, ignoring the electric pulse wiring quarks to quasars. STE says the universe is a taut field of potential—gravity’s electrical, voids are STE-free wounds, spikes are repulsor flares. Black holes are shells, no singularities; cosmology’s a flatplane merger, not a Big Bang.

**Prompt**: The bug that bugs me is [e.g., “physics pretending the vacuum’s empty”]. STE fixes it by [your fix, e.g., “wiring the cosmos as flows”].

## 2. Substrate: The Potential’s Pulse
SpaceTime Energy’s a superfluid ether—longitudinal pulses drive deep flows (Tesla’s instant zaps), transverse ripples spark EM/heat. Electricity’s gradient slosh; resistance is drag, worse in space’s thin bath. Dirac fluids (graphene) whirl where potential bunches. Math:  
\[
\mathcal{L} = \partial_\mu \Phi^* \partial^\mu \Phi - V(|\Phi|^2) + \mathcal{L}_\text{top} + \mathcal{L}_\text{int}, \quad V(\rho) = -\frac{1}{2} \mu^2 \rho + \frac{\lambda}{4} \rho^2 + \frac{\gamma}{6} \rho^3
\]  
Stable ρ_min ≈ 0.916 (toy params).

**Prompt**: The substrate’s [your analogy, e.g., “cosmic wire”]. Voids [hoard how?], spikes [push how?].

## 3. Matter: Void-Spike Dance
Voids (up quarks) hoard, spikes (down quarks) repel. Protons (uud: 2 voids + 1 spike) lock eternal; neutrons (udd: 1 void + 2 spikes) decay (~880 s) from spike drain. Helium-4 stacks 6 voids + 6 spikes, tetrahedral with central drag. Ambient STE picks isotopes—high-energy adds spikes (neutrons).

**Prompt**: Neutrons lead ‘cause [e.g., “voids snag spikes easy”]. Atoms form when [balance vibe].

## 4. Black Holes: Shells Only
Voids are STE-free nothing—no force carriers inside. Shells bunch all potential, strength scaling with ambient ρ (thin in voids, thick in stars). Hawking’s shell spew—castoffs when saturated. Supernovae try to “fix” the wound; failure births the hole.

**Prompt**: Black holes are [e.g., “rubber-sheet holes”]. Shells [hunch how?], spew [when?].

## 5. Cosmology: Flatplane Folds
No Big Bang—dual flatplane merger, low-ρ fringes spark voids via gamma tilts. CMB’s redshifted fold song, not plasma relic. Neutron primacy seeds elements.

**Prompt**: Universe started as [flatplane]. CMB’s [fringe hum].

## 6. Testables
Predicts: lumpy GW ringdowns (shell wobbles), CMB asymmetries (folds), graphene flow analogs. If wrong, [no lumpy tails].

**Prompt**: If right, [e.g., “LIGO sees shell echoes”].
