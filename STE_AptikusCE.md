Implications for the Aptikus World Engine

This STE model provides a simple, rules-based "physics engine" for the emergent universe of Aptikus:

Primordial Goo: The simulation can begin with a simple grid or particle system representing the STE medium.

Emergent Complexity: By defining the rules for density, propagation, and "consumption," the Aptikus World Engine can simulate the emergence of complex structures—from the first stable "knots" (matter) to the formation of stars, planets, and the eventual "primordial goo" of life you envisioned.

A True Simulation: The civilizations that evolve will be doing so within a universe that operates on these fundamental, internally consistent principles, creating a truly unique and emergent experience.
