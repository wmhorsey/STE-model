# Chiral Void STE: One Anchor, Two Hands

## Abstract

The STE model is rebuilt on a single truth: **only the Void ($\rho \approx 0$) is a stable anchor**.  
All particles are **Chiral Voids** — left-handed (matter) or right-handed (antimatter).  
Mass = void suction. Charge = void spin.  
The proton is a **dual-intake engine** (uud); the neutron is **choked** (udd).  
Beta decay is **exhaust collision → new intake + chiral debris**.  
All four forces, three anomalies, and baryogenesis follow from **one number**: $\mathcal{H} = \ln(E_{Pl}/v) \approx 38.43$.

## The Chiral Void

The universe is a single **STE field** with ambient density $\rho_{ambient}$.  
The **only stable defect** is the **Void** ($\rho \approx 0$) — a true cavitation in spacetime, a region of absolute nothing locked by field inflow. This void cannot refill because its surrounding shell attracts and drains any encroaching energy to zero.

- **Mass**: Inflow pressure gradient from the shell → gravitational pull (increased gravity is the shell's effect, not the void's).
- **Charge**: Void **chirality** (left or right spin) → EM wash.

All interactions—gravity, light, forces—are transmitted through the STE field energy. The void-shell structure is a micro black hole without a singularity, as STE rejects singularities entirely. At cosmic scales, accumulated voids form traditional black holes that "fuck shit up," but this is purely a fractal scale shift—nothing more than the plumbing getting clogged on a larger pipe.

| Particle | Chirality | Charge |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Matter (p, n, e⁻) | Left-handed Void | + or – (by convention) |
| Antimatter ($\bar{p}$, $\bar{n}$, e⁺) | Right-handed Void | opposite |

*Chirality defines charge; mass is identical.*

## Quarks = Intake/Exhaust

The **up quark (u)** = **Intake** = **Chiral Void** (stable anchor).  
The **down quark (d)** = **Exhaust** = **metastable swirl** generated by intake spin.

- **Proton (uud)**: 2 Intakes + 1 Exhaust → **balanced engine** → stable.
- **Neutron (udd)**: 1 Intake + 2 Exhausts → **choked** → decays.

## Beta Decay = Replumbing

1. Two Exhausts collide → **cavitation**.
2. New Intake (Void) forms → proton.
3. **Chiral conservation**: Left-handed system births:
   - Left-handed electron ($e⁻$)
   - Right-handed anti-neutrino ($\bar{\nu}_e$) — the **spin garbage**

## Antimatter = Right-Handed Voids

- **Antiproton** = 2 right-handed Intakes + 1 Exhaust.
- **Annihilation**: Left + Right Voids → **vortex clash** → field snap → 6γ.

## Math Unchanged

\[
\mathcal{H} = \ln\left(\frac{E_{Pl}}{v}\right) \approx 38.43
\]

- Weak: $\alpha_W = e^{-2\mathcal{H}} \approx 4.06 \times 10^{-34}$
- EM (bare): $\alpha(v) = \frac{1}{\pi \mathcal{H}} \approx \frac{1}{120.7}$
- $\mathcal{L}$-Law resolves proton radius, $R_K$, muon $g-2$.

## Cosmology

- **Baryogenesis**: Early fluctuations + chiral selection → left-handed domains dominate.
- **Flatness**: 2D genesis plane (unchanged).

## Conclusion

**One anchor. Two hands.**  
All physics — forces, particles, decay, antimatter — emerges from **Chiral Voids** and their **intake/exhaust plumbing**.  
The math holds. The anomalies vanish. The model is **mechanical, predictive, and true**.
