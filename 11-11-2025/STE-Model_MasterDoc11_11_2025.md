## Abstract

The STE model unifies all four fundamental forces, particles, and anomalies as emergent properties of a single SpaceTime Energy (STE) fluid. The universe is a fluid with ambient density ρ_ambient, governed by a Lagrangian ℒ_STE summing kinetic/field, gravity, weak, electromagnetic, and scalar terms. The only stable anchor is the Chiral Void (ρ ≈ 0), with handedness defining charge and suction defining mass.

Particles are Chiral Voids: Left-handed (matter) or right-handed (antimatter). Quarks are not particles but emergent flow patterns: up quarks as stable void cores (intakes), down quarks as metastable flares/spikes (exhausts). The proton (uud) is a dual-intake engine with a collective spike; the neutron (udd) is an unstable source engine.

Forces emerge geometrically:
- Gravity: 3D bulk tension.
- Strong: 2D shell tension + void-locking/flare-quenching.
- Weak: 3D→2D holographic projection (α_W = (v/E_Pl)^2).
- EM: 2D→2D leaked flare interaction, throttled by logarithmic lensing (L = α ln(m_probe/m_e)).

Anomalies resolved: Proton radius (3.89% vs. 3.80%), R_K (0.844 vs. 0.846), muon g-2 (2.07 ppm vs. 2.14 ppm). Baryogenesis via chiral selection. Cosmology: Flatness from 2D genesis plane.

One anchor. Two hands. One fluid.

## 1. Core Axiom: STE Fluid & Chiral Void

The universe is a single STE fluid with ambient density ρ_ambient. Dynamics governed by ℒ_STE = Kinetic/Field - Gravity - Weak - EM - Scalar.

The only stable defect: Chiral Void (ρ ≈ 0), a cavitation locked by inflow. Chirality (spin) → charge; inflow gradient → mass/gravity.

Duality: Voids (stable sinks) vs. Spikes (unstable outflows/pressure vents).

---

## 2. Lagrangian & Forces

ℒ_STE = [½ρ(∂φ/∂t_u)^2 - ½c²ρ(∇φ)^2] - [½(ρ²/ρ_Higgs)] - [α_W ρ ln(ρ/ρ_ambient)] - [α ρ ln(m_probe/m_e)] - V(Φ)

Forces:
- Gravity: 3D bulk tension (self-attraction).
- Strong: 2D surface tension (shell confinement) + nuclear binding (void-locking/flare-quenching).
- Weak: 3D→2D holographic projection.
- EM: 2D→2D leaked flare (throttled by L).

---

## 3. Particles: Voids, Spikes, and Plumbing

Particles: Chiral Voids (left: matter, right: antimatter).

Quarks as emergent flow patterns:
- Up Quark: Stable void core (intake, ρ ≈ 0 anchor).
- Down Quark: Metastable flare/spike (exhaust, high-ρ vent).

Proton Plumbing: Dual-intake (uud) engine. Neutron: Choked (udd).

---

## 4. Proton & Neutron Engines

- **Proton (uud)**: Bound engine. Two u-voids in stable "dance," creating collective d-spike (flare). Stable due to void-locking and flare-quenching.
- **Neutron (udd)**: Source engine. Single u-void with two d-flares. Unstable due to flare attraction/repulsion "dance."

---

## 5. Beta Decay: Flare Collision (Canon)

Neutron decay: d-flares attract via nonlocal fluid pull, repel via Pauli-like pressure. Collision (d+d → cavitation) creates new u-void, reforming shell into proton (uud). Excess energy: Electron (flare remnant) + antineutrino (shockwave).

Half-life: Emergent from fluid viscosity/drag balancing attraction.

---

## 6. Strong Force: Void-Locking & Flare-Quenching

Confinement: 2D shell tension (v ≈ 246 GeV).

Nuclear: Void-locking (u-voids bind) + flare-quenching (d-flares stabilize in shared resonances, e.g., deuterium).

---

## 7. Electromagnetism: Leaked Flare

EM: 2D→2D leaked interaction from d-flares (spikes). Throttled by L for mass-dependent effects. Alpha (1/137): Fluid's "squeeze" resistance.

---

## 8. Anomalies & Logarithmic Lensing

L = α ln(m_probe/m_e) resolves:
- Proton radius: δ = L ≈ 3.89% (measured 3.80%).
- R_K: S_f = 4L ≈ 0.156 → R_K = 1 - S_f ≈ 0.844 (measured 0.846).
- Muon g-2: Δa_μ = L α² ≈ 2.07 × 10^{-6} (measured 2.14 × 10^{-6}).

---

## 9. Hierarchy Problem & Holography

Weak scale v vs. Planck E_Pl: Holographic projection α_W = (v/E_Pl)^2 ≈ 4.07 × 10^{-34}. 10^{17} gap: Geometric scaling.

---

## 10. Cosmology

Baryogenesis: Chiral selection in early fluctuations → left-handed dominance.

Flatness: 2D genesis plane.

Dark energy: Ambient fluid pressure.

---

## 11. Speculative Elements

- **Spin-Flip Beta Decay**: Hypothetical mechanism where half-life arises from probabilistic spin flips (d↑ → d↓) via fluid jitter, triggering instant collision. Not canon; under review for fluid-dynamic consistency.

---

## 12. Simulation Roadmap

Phase 1: Theory consolidation (this doc).

Phase 2: Toy model sims.
- Neutron decay: 1D/2D agent-based (flares as agents with attraction/repulsion/drag/jitter forces). Validate exponential decay curve matching 15-min half-life.
- Proton stability: u-u bound dance with collective spike.

Phase 3: Predictions (e.g., neutron bottle anomaly, redshift drag).

## 13. Conclusion

STE: Mechanical, predictive, true. Fluid anchors all physics. Next: Simulations for proof.

One anchor. Two hands. One fluid.
