# AI Coding Agent Instructions for STE Model

## Project Overview
This repository contains the SpaceTime Energy (STE) Model - a unified physics framework where the universe is a single superfluid medium. All forces, matter, and cosmology emerge from fluid dynamics. The model aims to replace disparate particles/forces with emergent properties of STE density (ρ) and flow patterns.

## Core Architecture
- **STE Fluid**: Fundamental near-zero-viscosity medium with ambient density ρ_ambient
- **Gravity**: Bulk self-attraction of STE fluid (not a separate force)
- **Speed of Light (c)**: Speed of tension/pulses through STE medium
- **Matter**: Emergent from stable resonant flow-patterns ("knots") in STE fluid
- **Void Cores (Up Quarks)**: Fundamental stable particles - spikes around central voids
- **Spikes (Down Quarks)**: Emergent "splash zones" from void core siphons
- **Nuclear Forces**: Fluid-dynamic interactions between voids/spikes
- **EM Force**: Vortex dynamics (spin polarity)
- **Cosmology**: Cyclical "Planck Pancake" model without singularities

## Development Patterns
### Physics Modeling
- Use fluid dynamics analogies (Bernoulli's principle, vortices, cavitation)
- Prefer mechanical explanations over abstract mathematics
- Focus on emergent complexity from simple rules
- Include testable predictions that differ from standard models

### Mathematical Notation
- ρ = energy density (kg/m³)
- θ = phase/flow direction
- μ = tachyonic scale (~10^{-18} s⁻¹)
- λ = stabilizer (~1/137, fine-structure constant)
- γ = spike cap (~10^{-2}λ)
- g = Yukawa coupling (~√(4πα))

### Simulation Approach
```python
# Basic STE simulation pattern
phi = sqrt(ρ) * exp(i*θ)  # Complex field
# RK4 integration of Klein-Gordon equation
# Track energy conservation: ∫ρ dV ≈ const
```

## Integration Points
- **Aptikus Game Engine**: STE provides physics rules for emergent universe simulation
- **Real Physics**: Bridges GR (geometry) ↔ QFT (fluctuations) ↔ Cosmology (expansion)
- **Testable Predictions**: Neutron lifetime anomaly, CMB anisotropies, BH mass gaps
- **AI Collaboration**: Different LLMs (Gemini, Grok) generate model variants

## Critical Workflows
- **Model Refinement**: Compare versions, merge insights, resolve contradictions
- **Prediction Development**: Create falsifiable tests differing from standard physics
- **Conceptual History**: Track "why" behind structural decisions
- **Chaos Engine**: Implement Aptikus CE rules for complexity emergence

## Project-Specific Conventions
- Multiple .md files for different model aspects/versions
- LaTeX math in markdown for equations
- References to arXiv papers and physics literature
- Pseudocode examples for simulation methods
- Emphasis on mechanical intuition over pure mathematics

## Common Pitfalls
- Don't treat STE as traditional particle physics - it's fluid dynamics
- Gravity ≠ separate force - it's bulk fluid self-pull
- Matter ≠ fundamental particles - emergent resonant patterns
- Time ≠ flowing dimension - measurement of process rates
- Cosmology ≠ Big Bang - cyclical pancake mergers

## Quality Checks
- Does the explanation use fluid/mechanical analogies?
- Are predictions testable and different from standard models?
- Does it maintain energy conservation?
- Can it be implemented in Aptikus simulation?
